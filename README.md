# Control-Flow

# Discount Calculator with Control Flow

This is the updated program of the discount calculator. The Python program, 'crt_flw_discnt_price.py', includes control flow statements i.e. if-else statements. After calculating the discounted price, the program determines the cost category of the item based on the following criteria:

- If the discounted price is less than $50, it prints "Low-cost item."
- If the discounted price is between $50 and $100, it prints "Moderate-cost item."
- If the discounted price is above $100, it prints "High-cost item."

Additionally, the program also prompts the user for the original cost.

# Data Type of elements with control flow

This python program, 'crt_flw_DT.py', gives the data type of each element of the 'mixed_data' list in the first program. This is done via the following:

- A 'for' loop has been implemented to iterate from 0 till the length of 'mixed_data' list, printing each element along with its data type.
